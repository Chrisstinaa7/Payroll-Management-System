Description:
In this project, I have developed a Payroll Management System in Java, utilizing an abstract class called "Employee." This class defines the blueprint for various types of employees within an organization. It enforces the implementation of essential methods such as setting and getting social security numbers, first names, last names, and calculating payment amounts.

Key Features and Contributions:

Abstract Class: The "Employee" class serves as an abstract base for different employee types, ensuring a consistent interface for managing employee information and payments.
Polymorphism: Through this abstract class, I've demonstrated the power of polymorphism, allowing for the creation of concrete employee subclasses with their own implementations of abstract methods.
Data Encapsulation: The use of getter and setter methods ensures secure access to employee data while maintaining code readability.
Payment Calculation: The abstract method "getPaymentAmount()" allows for specialized payment calculations for each employee type, accommodating various compensation structures.
String Representation: The "toString()" method provides a standardized way to represent employee data as strings for easy logging and display.
This project exemplifies my skills in object-oriented programming and design, showcasing the ability to create a flexible and extensible system for managing employee data and payroll processing in a Java-based application.
